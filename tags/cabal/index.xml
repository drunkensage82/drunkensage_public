      <description>It is starting to look more and more like Black Mirror is not science fiction at all&amp;hellip;.but maybe it is the cabal just telling us what to expect? This incident is proof we are inching closer and closer to many of the Black Mirror episodes&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Why is everything I buy a piece of shit? Something I have noticed more and more, is just how terribly everything is built anymore. From furniture, homes, clothing, electronics, you name it&amp;hellip;.it is all junk!!!
For me, this has been pretty obvious, as I have watched product quality decline more and more over my life. But it seems to be hitting all time lows. Recently I decided to be on the lookout for an antique can opener, just because you can&amp;rsquo;t buy a hand crank can opener anymore that will open even a dozen cans without breaking&amp;hellip;one of the many things that still trigger anger in me, and do it pretty quickly!</description>
