      <description>In this video, Dr. Scott Mandelker points out that trying to force a state of affability at all times could be an error. I tend to agree with his points made&amp;hellip;that if you are &amp;ldquo;forcing&amp;rdquo; it, than you are essentially in the act of spiritual bypassing&amp;hellip;pretending all is well, when maybe in fact, it isn&amp;rsquo;t! Maybe sometimes the right action, or right view is indeed acknowledging the negative, and returning negativity with equal positive force&amp;hellip;great video, and very timely for myself!</description>

      <description>Bernhard Guenther does a great job breaking down the false love/light narrative that is so wide spread through the new age and spiritual awakening movement.</description>

      <description>I have recently come across the work of Bernhard Guenther and Laura Matsue and have been enjoying their podcasts and perspective on the soul awakening/enlightenment journey. This particular podcast episode hits home for myself, as I recently began to understand just how much the false &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; or ego I was actually dealing with.
I spent years after my awakening gorging myself on all the spiritual information I could get my hands on.</description>
