      <description>Why is everything I buy a piece of shit? Something I have noticed more and more, is just how terribly everything is built anymore. From furniture, homes, clothing, electronics, you name it&amp;hellip;.it is all junk!!!
For me, this has been pretty obvious, as I have watched product quality decline more and more over my life. But it seems to be hitting all time lows. Recently I decided to be on the lookout for an antique can opener, just because you can&amp;rsquo;t buy a hand crank can opener anymore that will open even a dozen cans without breaking&amp;hellip;one of the many things that still trigger anger in me, and do it pretty quickly!</description>

      <description>While details about myself I feel are rather non-important, they might help you to better understand my journey, and see the lens that distorts my viewpoints.
After discovering meditation and practicing it daily over the course of several months, I was blessed to have an experience of the divine.
This presence I felt was one of that of overwhelming love, and I was surrounded by a brilliant white light. I have no idea how long this lasted, but it felt I was in a place of complete timelessness.</description>
