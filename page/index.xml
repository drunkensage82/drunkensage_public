      <description>While details about myself I feel are rather non-important, they might help you to better understand my journey, and see the lens that distorts my viewpoints.
After discovering meditation and practicing it daily over the course of several months, I was blessed to have an experience of the divine.
This presence I felt was one of that of overwhelming love, and I was surrounded by a brilliant white light. I have no idea how long this lasted, but it felt I was in a place of complete timelessness.</description>
