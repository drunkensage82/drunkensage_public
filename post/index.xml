      <description>I have recently come across the work of Bernhard Guenther and Laura Matsue and have been enjoying their podcasts and perspective on the soul awakening/enlightenment journey. This particular podcast episode hits home for myself, as I recently began to understand just how much the false &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; or ego I was actually dealing with.
I spent years after my awakening gorging myself on all the spiritual information I could get my hands on.</description>

      <description>Why is everything I buy a piece of shit? Something I have noticed more and more, is just how terribly everything is built anymore. From furniture, homes, clothing, electronics, you name it&amp;hellip;.it is all junk!!!
For me, this has been pretty obvious, as I have watched product quality decline more and more over my life. But it seems to be hitting all time lows. Recently I decided to be on the lookout for an antique can opener, just because you can&amp;rsquo;t buy a hand crank can opener anymore that will open even a dozen cans without breaking&amp;hellip;one of the many things that still trigger anger in me, and do it pretty quickly!</description>
